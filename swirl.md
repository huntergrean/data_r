# Swirl() Notes
## Lesson 8: Logic
### General notes
Some examples of Logical operators in R include:
* ==
* <=
* !=
* & and &&
* | and ||

for the && and || operators, they will only be applied to the first value of a vector 
& and | are applied to all values of the vector
### New commands
**isTrue()** If the argument passed to this function evaluates to TRUE, then it returns true. ALL other values (including numbers) will return false.

**indentical()** If the arguments passed are all identical, it evaluates to TRUE

**xor()** This function returns TRUE if *only one* of the arguments passed to it are true. It is the exclusive or.

**sample(10)** This gives us a random sampling of integers from 1 to 10 without replacement

**which()** The which function will return the index location of the items in the vector that meet the logical condition passed to the function

**and()** This function returns true if any elements of a vector meet the logical condition passed to it

**all()** This function returns true if ALL elements of the vector meet the logical condition passed to it

##Lesson 9: Functions
### General Notes
You can pass functions as arguments to other functions
You can set default values when writing functions 
You can pass a function as an argument without having defined the passed function. This is an anonymous function.
All arguments passed to a function after "..." MUST have a default value

When sending values in the parenthesis to a function, we call this passing an argument to a function

User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:

      %[whatever]% 
      
where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.

### New commands
**Sys.Date()**  returns the date

**mean()** returns the arithmetical average of all passed arguments

**args()** pass a function to this function to see its arguments and default values

**sd()** calculates the standard deviation

**paste()** will combine any number of strings into one string

##Lesson 10: Apply Functions

###General Notes

In general, if the result of sapply() is a list where every element is of length one, then sapply() returns a vector. If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (> 1), sapply() returns a matrix. If sapply() can't figure things out, then it just returns a list, no different from what lapply() would give you.

lapply(OBJECT, function(dummy) dummy[2]) will return a list containing the second item from each element of the OBJECT list. Note that the function takes one argument, dummy, which is just a 'dummy variable' that takes on the value of each element of OBJECT, in turn. By defining our own function inside the call to lapply let's us do things in one line of code when R's built in functions isn't an option

###New commands
head() will reveal column names and first 6 lines of data.frame

dim() will reveal the number of rows and columns of a data.frame

class() will reveal the class of an object. each column of a data.frame as its own class

lapply(OBJECT, FUNCTION) will take an object and apply the specified function to each of its component and return a list

sapply(OBJECT, FUNCTION) will take an object and apply passed function to each component and return a vector, matrix, or list

sum(DATAFRAMENAME#COLUMN_NAME) will apply the sum function to columns indicated in the data frame

NEW_VARIABLE_NAME <- DATAFRAME_NAME[,XX:YY] will subset the contents of the dataframe into a new dataframe with the XXth to the YYth columns. By having a blank before the column, this means all rows will be kept but only the XX:YY columns will be kept.
